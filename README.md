# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built as a **dynamic, maintainable content system** rather than a static resume page.

The site serves as a public-facing professional profile while allowing controlled updates to content without repeated code changes.

## Overview

Traditional portfolios are static snapshots that quickly become outdated.  
This project was approached as an engineering problem: **how to design a lightweight, extensible system for presenting professional information over time**.

The result is a clean public interface backed by a private, client-side admin panel that enables content updates such as:
- experience
- projects
- skills
- education

without modifying the main site structure.

## Key Features

- Static, fast-loading public portfolio
- Password-protected admin interface for content management
- Ability to add, edit, reorder, and hide sections dynamically
- Image handling utilities for project content
- Fully client-side implementation
- Hosted using GitHub Pages for simplicity and reliability

---

## Technical Notes

- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- No backend services or databases
- No external APIs or credentials
- Designed to be simple, transparent, and easy to maintain

### Security Note

> This portfolio is intentionally implemented as a **client-side system only**.  
> The admin interface does not expose backend services, databases, or sensitive credentials.  
> It is designed for personal content management and demonstration purposes.

## Design Philosophy

This project reflects my broader approach to engineering:
- Treat workflows as systems worth designing
- Reduce repetitive effort through tooling
- Prioritize clarity, maintainability, and long-term usability
- Build simple solutions that scale with need

While the site appears minimal, it is structured to evolve continuously as my work and experience grow.
